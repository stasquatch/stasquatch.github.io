### Summary

The `head` tag is where metadata about the page will go, such as
page title, stylesheet links, and SEO information. Outside of your typical
HTML webpage, the `head` tag should not be used for iframe, srcdoc, or
email content. This blog entry will only be covering `head` as it's used
in typical web development.

Typical children of the `head` tag include:

- `title`
- `base`
- `link`
- `style`
- `meta`
- `script`
- `noscript`
- `template`

While it's not strictly required, it's good practice to include it. If
you omit the tag, browsers will usually insert it for you. Because
browsers can have different behavior, you _may_ get unexpected side effects
relying on this implementation.

`head` must be the first child of the `html` tag (`body` being the second child).

### Attributes

In previous specs, the `profile` attribute could be used. This has been removed
in HTML5.
