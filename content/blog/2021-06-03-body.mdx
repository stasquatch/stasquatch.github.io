### Summary

The `body` tag is where nearly all your presentational HTML will go.
It's considered a section element, in good company with `nav`, `section`,
and others. Section elements are used to provide meaningful structure
to the page, so that browsers and assistive devices have more context
to the content within each element. For example, a `nav` should be
interpreted differently than a `body` element.

While it's not strictly required, it's good practice to include it. If
you omit the tag, browsers will usually insert it for you. Because
browsers can have different behavior, you _may_ get unexpected side effects
relying on this implementation. Explicitly defining the `body` tag also
allows you to define the language of the document, if you haven't already
defined it on the `html` tag.

`body` must be the second child of the `html` tag (`head` being the first child).

In JavaScript, you can access the body element via `document.body`.

### Attributes

`lang`

While you can set the `lang` and `dir` on a `body` tag, you typically should set it
on the `html` instead. Setting the `lang` on `body` means all the meta information
in the `head` tag will be lacking the language declaration.

### Usage

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

    …
