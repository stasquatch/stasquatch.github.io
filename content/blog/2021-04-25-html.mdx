### Summary

`html` is the root element, so all your HTML should live inside this tag.
While it's not strictly required, it's good practice to include it. If
you omit the tag, browsers will usually insert it for you. Because
browsers can have different behavior, you _may_ get unexpected side effects
relying on this implementation. Explicitly defining the `html` tag also
allows you to define the language of the document.

Immediate children can only be one [`head`](/2021-05-03-head) and one [`body`](/2021-05-03-body) (in that order).

The CSS psuedo-class `:root` will select the `html` tag.

### Attributes

`lang`

The `lang` attribute accepts any valid language code and defaults to `unknown`.
This attribute tells screen readers what language to use to announce the page.
Depending on the language code you set in the `lang` attribute, you may also want to
set `dir="rtl"` on the `html` tag to denote whether text is read right-to-left
or left-to-right.
